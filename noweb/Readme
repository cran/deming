This is source code for part of the package written in noweb.  It allows for
much more extensive documentation of the mathematical aspects of the code
by wrapping it into a latex document.  You will want to have the "noweb"
R package installed on your machine to make changes.

"make fun" extracts the embedded R code and places a copy in ../R.  Make sure
to run this before submitting a new version to CRAN.  We don't do this
automatically via a ../configure script so that those who are installing
from source, but not modifying it, do not need to have to have the noweb
package installed.  Even more importantly, it means that I don't have to
a Makefile that works on all possible hardware.  The ../cleanup script is
run by R CMD build, so again the Makefile only needs to be valid for my machine.

"make deming.pdf" creates a pdf version of the code.  This is the version 
intended for human consumption.
